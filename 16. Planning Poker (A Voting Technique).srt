1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,760
OK, so we know what story points are now it's time to assign story points to the PBIS.

2
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:09,010
How do we do that?

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,340
One way is to use Ploning poker.

4
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,200
I'll be honest with you, in the company I work for, we do not use this technique.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,770
We've never tried it.

6
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,190
But here is the concept.

7
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:24,770
Each member holds several cards with numbers on them.

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,600
A PVA is presented and each member gets to vote.

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,600
But here is the interesting part.

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,960
They pick up a card and hold it face down.

11
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,110
Then when everyone is ready, the cards are shown at once.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,720
You might be thinking why?

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,220
Let me tell you, if the voting happens one person after another, the decisions will be influenced

14
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:51,090
by the first person who votes.

15
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,570
This is not good.

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,780
It's a cognitive bias called anchoring.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,690
We use this frequently in marketing when we present prices.

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,610
Let me give you an example.

19
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:07,210
I will show the product and I'll tell you, this product costs 200 dollars.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,540
I want to use that price to hundred dollars as an anchor, but then for a limited time only you can

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,470
buy that product for thirty dollars, which is a huge discount.

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,020
And in your mind, the deal you're getting is amazing.

23
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,110
This is the power of anchoring.

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,820
The same effect happens when we vote one after another.

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:36,590
Now imagine the most experienced developer votes, 20 story points for an item and everybody sees that

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,830
they will pick something very close to that number.

27
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:46,550
Some people would not even consider what they think their own opinion, because if this experience developer

28
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,120
thinks so, that must be the case, right?

29
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,880
No, this is not the result we want.

30
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:58,280
Everyone holds the cards face down and they are shown it was.

31
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,920
But what happens next?

32
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,670
We want to take a look at the highest number and the lowest number, for example, one person voted

33
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,780
20 story points.

34
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,980
Another person voted 100 sort points.

35
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,490
Well, what does this tell us?

36
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,250
That's a huge difference.

37
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,090
Maybe one of the developers does not precisely understand the task at hand or the other one is still

38
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,720
considering important points.

39
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:29,690
In any case, we do another discussion to clarify and then we would vote again after that.

40
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,870
So if the numbers are more or less in the same range, we take an average and go with it.

41
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,010
That's it.

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,400
We go to the next PBI in revoltingly.

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,320
OK, this was the planning pocho concept.

44
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,430
It's not mandatory scrum, but many scrum teams use it.

45
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,940
Thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
