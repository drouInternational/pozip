1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:09,280
One of the focus areas on the spill, one example is product backlog management or refinement.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,070
By the way, in the past it was called product backlog, product backlog grooming.

3
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:20,920
But the worst grooming has negative meanings in some countries, and that's the reason why it was changed

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,790
to a refinement.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,230
In the video about the product owner, I've mentioned and explained what product backlog refinement

6
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,980
is, the purpose of this lecture is to broaden your understanding of the topic so you can confidently

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,490
answer questions related to it on your exam.

8
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,460
First of all, let's see what this guy says.

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:53,240
Product backlog items that can be done by the within one sprint are deemed ready for selection in a

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:01,320
Sprint planning event, they usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities for

11
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:01,860
the backlog.

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,660
Refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining product backlog items into smaller, more

13
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,560
precise items.

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:17,030
This is an ongoing activity to add details such as a description, order and size attributes, often

15
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,460
very with the domain of work.

16
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,750
The developers who will be doing the work are responsible for deciding the product.

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,360
Owner may influence the developers by helping them understand in select trade offs.

18
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,680
This middle passage says a lot of things, but let's take a look at that example.

19
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,350
First of all, you know that we have a scrum event that is designed to collect feedback.

20
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,670
Do you remember which one of those?

21
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:54,130
I hope you've answered Sprint Review, but in reality, we can receive feedback at any time you are

22
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,000
the product owner and the customer comes up with a great idea.

23
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,220
He or she comes to your office because they want to share the idea in person.

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,300
It is in the middle of the sprint.

25
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,820
And in fact, you like the idea.

26
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,390
You assume that it would bring a lot of value as well.

27
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,780
What do you do next?

28
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,680
You write a product backlog, I tell.

29
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,700
And this is where the developers step in, why?

30
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:27,060
First you explain the idea to them and they would say if there are any technical limitations or dependencies,

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,720
and second, they would estimate the size of the item.

32
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,230
In this way, the product owner would have an idea of how much time and effort would go into the development

33
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,980
of that item.

34
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,250
And based on that, the product owner would decide the order of the item if it is quick and easy to

35
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,550
do.

36
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,590
But it would bring a lot of value.

37
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:52,830
The product owner would put it on top of the product backlog if the same item would bring again a lot

38
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,570
of value, but it takes a lot of time to do, then the product owner would not be willing to put it

39
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,010
on top.

40
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,420
They would put it in a lower position.

41
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,940
My point is that we receive feedback spontaneously.

42
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,040
This is why product backlog refinement is an ongoing process is, you know, by now we don't have a

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,550
rule anymore as to how much time the developer should spend doing product backlog refinement.

44
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,600
Also, the product owner spends as much time as needed refining the product backlog.

45
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,360
Sometimes product owners can do product backlog refinement by themselves, they do not need the developers

46
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,570
all the time when refining, for example, there are 10 independent PBIS, all of them estimated in

47
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,120
the product owner wants to reorder them.

48
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,690
That's fine.

49
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,380
He or she goes ahead and does it or maybe some of the PBS are not relevant anymore.

50
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,230
No problem.

51
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:47,110
The product owner goes ahead and removes them.

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,880
But what is absolutely necessary for you to know for your exam is that the product owner does not estimate

53
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,950
the size of the items in the product.

54
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,740
Owner does not tell the developers how many items to pull from the product backlog to the spring backlog.

55
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,480
But another rule is this the developers must choose all the items from the very top of the product that

56
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,720
look downwards.

57
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:17,470
It is not acceptable for the developers to go ahead and pick items from the middle of the product backlog.

58
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:22,480
Of course, all things being equal here, the items on top are refined and ready for development.

59
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,480
I know I'm repeating myself, but these are the details that that you will see in the questions on the

60
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:35,930
one exam, because when you know the rules, it's easy.

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,890
Imagine you read following the product owner estimated the size of the PBA to be.

62
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,470
That's it.

63
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:44,480
You already know that this is not correct.

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,990
And whatever scenarios and to give you after that, they give you the question, no problem.

65
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,430
They cannot confuse, you know, the rules.

66
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,890
The next time I remember, it was a similar situation, but it was about the product owner changing

67
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,060
the definition of them without consulting with the developers.

68
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,140
Not acceptable.

69
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,650
We will talk about that soon.

70
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:15,160
Now, an effective scrum team is one that does product backlog refinement in the result is PBIS for

71
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,580
approximately two sprints ahead in the product backlog that are ready to be selected for development.

72
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:24,520
Let's say the developers do 10 PBIS first print.

73
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,490
Well, that means approximately 20 PBIS.

74
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,970
The first 20 PBI should be refined.

75
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,250
This is a characteristic of high performing scrum teams, but it is not a rule.

76
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:41,980
Refind means the developers understand them well enough to start working on them immediately.

77
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:50,390
Now, a question for you, let's say you have a product backlog with 150 PBIS if product backlog refinement.

78
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,030
Is that good?

79
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,670
Should you as a product owner, of course, together with the developers, go ahead and refine all 150

80
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,120
items?

81
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:59,590
What do you think?

82
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,440
The answer is no, you should not.

83
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:12,290
It's not a good idea why, because there will be a lot of items out of these 150 that the developers

84
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,470
will never do.

85
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,750
We consider this is waste.

86
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,150
We lost time, by the way.

87
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,860
I saw a question that revolves around that in the exam as well.

88
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,920
And finally, you've heard me a few times saying that items on top of the product backlog are ready

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,570
for development in here.

90
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:34,060
Another question appears, do we have a definition of readiness escrow?

91
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,540
We will answer this in the next lecture.

92
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,290
For now, let's recap from BackTalk.

93
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,910
Refinement is the act of adding details such as description order in size to the items in the product

94
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,440
backlog, product backlog.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,130
Refinement is an ongoing process and ongoing activity.

96
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,750
There is no official event for it because we receive feedback spontaneously.

97
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,960
We want to do product batuque refinement on an ad hoc basis.

98
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,400
The product owner and developers collaborate during product backlog refinement.

99
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,980
Only the developers do the sizing of the PBS.

100
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,400
If this from must end, the product owner do not act as developers.

101
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,600
The product owner spent as much time as needed refining the product backlog.

102
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,790
Effective scrum teams keep the PBIS on top of their product backlogs refind.

103
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,590
That means the items are ready for development immediately actionable.

104
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,080
Thank you for watching, interstate purposeful.
