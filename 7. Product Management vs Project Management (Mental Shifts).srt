00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:08,790
I want to start this lecture with the fourth sentence from the Agile Manifesto responding to change

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,670
over falling a plan, as you remember, from a previous lecture.

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,180
We do planning in our job, but what we don't do is be detailed, upfront plans for the whole project.

4
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:21,060
We want to be agile.

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,280
We want to be adaptive.

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,900
Instead of following a big plan, we won't allow the customer and the end user to provide us with feedback

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,530
and based on it, we develop accordingly.

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:38,430
With that being said, if you see questions related to measuring success, we schedule budget in scope.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,590
And I want to underline the word scope here.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,420
You should know that these are not measures of success.

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:54,710
Scrambled egg is very sensitive about the awards, product and project they believe in product management

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,740
and development, not project management.

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,460
You also know that in strong we do not have a project manager role, but in traditional project management,

14
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,070
we do have project managers, of course.

15
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:10,290
And what do these project managers do?

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,700
Very briefly, they gather information and create an initial plan with a scope, of course, time and

17
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,230
budget.

18
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,210
They ask for resources, they assign tasks.

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,680
Reporting is a big deal.

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,130
By the way.

21
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:29,180
Sometimes developers have to explain what they've been working on hour by hour, Gantt charts are being

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,350
used and so on.

23
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,590
Having said that, do not understand that project management is something that or it does not work.

24
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,280
Nor the problem comes when managers use it incorrectly.

25
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,800
Here is what I mean.

26
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:50,030
Most of the time, project managers measure success by adhering sticking to the initial plan as close

27
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,650
as possible.

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,900
The project has met the deadline.

29
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,020
It has to be on budget or under budget, within scope.

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,400
It all sounds good.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,510
It sounds logical.

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:08,140
But in the book, The Professional Product, the authors are asking, but what about projects that remain

33
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:12,910
on time, on budget and within scope and yet still do not succeed?

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,330
And they give us an example with Nokia, they produced mobile phones with a high success rate in terms

35
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,680
of their project.

36
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,090
Nokia was the leader in the mobile phone industry, the mobile phone market.

37
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,540
They followed very tight schedules to produce the phones, but they ended up as a Department of Microsoft.

38
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,570
Nokia didn't make the mental shift from project thinking to product thinking.

39
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:44,420
Again, it's about delivering value through products and not about delivering projects on time, budget

40
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:50,690
and within scope, simply simply because you can be on time, within budget, in the scope, but still

41
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,350
do not deliver value.

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,260
And I read something interesting, something funny on this topic.

43
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,610
It was a blog postings from the talk.

44
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,940
The operation succeeded as the project, but the patient died.

45
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,850
That's the product.

46
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:11,150
This is the result when project management is used incorrectly, when the focus is on the wrong place.

47
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,580
It is not on the end user.

48
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,450
And there needs.

49
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:23,060
And now the question is product owners who practice product development, what should we focus on?

50
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:32,230
Consider the Foley building the right product, focusing on meeting customers needs and happiness,

51
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,150
creating a product vision.

52
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:42,270
Balance in priority or risk value opportunities independence's to help you build the product in the

53
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:50,190
right way in the right order, maximizing revenue and ROIC, return on investment, measuring success

54
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:57,030
with business metrics like user adoption and retention in revenue or cost savings generated per feature,

55
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:02,670
frequently releasing product increments to obtain earlier feedback from the marketplace.

56
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,960
By using the product mindset and approach, we eliminate waste because we do less task management,

57
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:18,070
we do less people management as opposed to the project mindset instrument, you know that we have self

58
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,230
organizing teams.

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,960
Nobody pushes back to the development in the pool.

60
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,110
The items from the product backlog, they decompose the items into smaller units we call tasks.

61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,410
And then the developers, they assign the tasks to themselves that fosters creativity.

62
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:40,330
It's the supporting system instead of a task pushing system.

63
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,790
OK, time to recap.

64
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,720
Responding to change over following a plan.

65
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:52,720
Time, budget and scope are not the best measurements for success.

66
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,930
Yes, these metrics can be useful.

67
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,800
They are useful.

68
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,880
But this is not how you measure success in school successes.

69
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,450
Crumb is delivering value for products.

70
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,420
So we have happy end users, scrum teams and stakeholders.

71
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,090
Useful business metrics for the product owner are user adoption and retention.

72
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:18,040
We want to grow our customers and our customer base, but we also want to keep the customers we already

73
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,580
have.

74
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,540
Revenue or cost savings generated by our future.

75
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:30,640
We strive for higher revenue and lower costs for the organization in strong corporate management activities

76
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,340
are distributed among all members of the scrumpy.

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,500
We do not have an equivalent of a project manager.

78
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:47,190
In the next lecture, we will talk about the product back, look into attributes of the items in it.

79
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,410
Thank you for watching and stay purposeful.
