1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,780
Let's talk about the definition of them.

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:12,310
What is it the definition of them is a formal description of the state of the environment when it meets

3
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,030
the quality measures required for the product.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,910
The definition of then is not an artifact.

5
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,700
It is a commitment for an artifact.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,930
This is the increment.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,660
I've shared with you before, but I would like to think about the definition of an is a checklist.

8
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:37,390
These are all the points that the scrotum has to check off to say an item is done when an item is done.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,910
It means normal work is spending.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:48,550
It means that the item is usable by the end users, the moment a product backlog item meets the definition

11
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,350
of an increment is born.

12
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:57,520
This center says exactly the same because by default, an increment is tested and it is verified, it

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,380
is usable.

14
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,990
The definition of then is he must be strong and it increases transparency when we see this item is done.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,590
All the members of the team know what that means.

16
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:16,120
If the organization, the Scrum team works and has a definition of done is part of is part of its standards,

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,430
then the team must follow it as a minimum.

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:26,950
If it is not an organizational standard, then the entire scrumping creates a definition of done that

19
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,250
is appropriate for the product.

20
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:33,850
Of course, yes, the product owner now the product owner in the scrum master have a say in the definition

21
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:40,390
of the product owner input will be related to quality from a business point of view of the schoolmasters.

22
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,420
Input would be related to quality improvements to the definition of done.

23
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:52,000
After all, Kronosaurus main accountability is the effectiveness of the scrum team.

24
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,910
And to be effective, they the scrum team must have a strong definition of the.

25
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,230
And when I said improvements to the definition of done, do you remember during which event we usually

26
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,980
discuss the definition of them?

27
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,530
I hope you've answered Sprint retrospective Gujjar.

28
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,260
The developers are required to conform to the definition of done when skills crunch.

29
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,570
We have multiples from kids.

30
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,660
Now, a quick reminder here.

31
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:28,440
When we have multiple scrum teams working on the same product, we have one for the backlog.

32
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,250
We have one product owner in one product goal at any given time.

33
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:41,390
We have multiples from my source and, of course, developers, but we also have one integrated increment.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,450
In the scrum, we must mutually define and comply with the same definition of them for that integrated

35
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,080
increment.

36
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,250
Time for recap.

37
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,830
The definition of done is a formal description of the state of the increment when it meets the quality

38
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:05,610
measures required for the product, the definition of done is mandatory and it increases transparency

39
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,560
if the definition of done is part of organizational standards.

40
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,760
This company must follow it as a minimum.

41
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:19,830
If the definition of done is not part of organizational standards, this company must create one that

42
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,180
is appropriate for the product.

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,140
The definition of them may be improved during the project.

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:32,220
The result would be a higher quality of the work if multiples continue working on the same product they

45
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,460
mutually define and comply with the same definition of done for the integrated increment.

46
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,020
Thank you for watching.

47
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,390
I'll see you in the next video, state purposeful.
