00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:08,590
I would like to present to you the cone of uncertainty, and the reason is you might not see a question

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:14,560
asking directly what the cone of uncertainty is, but you might see a question asking about the concept.

3
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,210
And if you know the concept, you would answer quickly and correctly.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,510
So let's get to it.

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,270
The cone of uncertainty, what is it, what does it show?

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,750
Well, the key word here is uncertainty.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:35,100
What the cone represents is the fact that at the very beginning of the project, the uncertainty is

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:35,720
the highest.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,480
The more we do, the more we reduce uncertainty.

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,250
That's the whole deal here.

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,670
No need to complicate it, if you see questions about forecasts, just think about this.

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,020
The longer the forecast generally, the less accurate it will be, especially if you do a forecast at

13
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,680
the very beginning of the project where the uncertainty is the highest.

14
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,230
If you do it in the middle of the project, the forecast will be more accurate.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,460
The horizontal axis shows the time.

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:13,290
The vertical axis shows how much we know about the project and the progression of iterations or sprints

17
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,590
for the shape of the call.

18
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,610
We gain more knowledge.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,590
That's it.

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,830
Nothing complex here.

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,790
As you can see in the next video, we'll talk about technical debt.

22
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,920
Thank you for watching and stay purposeful.
