1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,610
You already know that the product owner is the value maximizer of the product.

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,270
And I believe this is one of the most important aspects to consider for this role in your.

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,850
One example, after all, is all about value driven development.

4
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,380
The keyword is value.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,000
So let's talk about it.

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,020
First of all, you should know that there is financial value.

7
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,440
This is what for profit companies strive for, but there is also societal value.

8
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,120
This is what non-profit companies strive for, charities.

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:44,030
And so you need to remember this because you might see a question if success is only measured by financial

10
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,510
value, such as money, income or revenue.

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,960
And so.

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:55,010
The correct answer here would be false, because you can measure success by societal values as well.

13
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,450
It's not always about revenue and you know, that's from can be used for any type of product.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,660
If we give it a deeper look.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,830
What does it stay behind, fellow?

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Happy inducers does the answer, everything revolves around fulfilling their needs.

17
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,090
This is why they pay to use the product.

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,860
So is a value maximizer.

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,110
You should be asking yourself.

20
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,250
What is the future that will bring the highest impact?

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,700
Well.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:32,100
And to make that to make that decision to be decisive, you must understand the product in the market

23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,680
of the product extremely well.

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,830
And if you do not have a business background, you don't know what the market is.

25
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,150
Let me explain simply.

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,870
The market is the people who have a need.

27
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,770
They want the product, but they can also afford it, so they have money to buy it.

28
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,740
You can also hear the term target audience.

29
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,860
That's OK as well.

30
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,540
So to know the market means knowing the end users to understand their needs.

31
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,330
Now, this does not mean that the product owner should do the legwork.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,780
It can be someone else, for example, a marketing department or surveys.

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,160
But the data has to come to you as a product owner.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,700
You have to it has to do that has to be analyzed by you.

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,760
And sometimes you might see differences between opinion, between the opinion of your customer, what

36
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:28,140
they want, and on the other hand, the end users and what the end users want.

37
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,870
What do you do in this case?

38
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,670
Which opinion is the heaviest?

39
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,330
What do you think?

40
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:45,000
It is the end users opinion be prepared for such a question on the exam so the people who pay to use

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,640
the product, the end users, are those whose wants and desires you must strive to satisfy.

42
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,930
First, of course, you do that in a civilized manner.

43
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:56,120
You have to wait.

44
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,410
You have to balance the opinions of all stakeholders.

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,910
So besides being decisive, the product owner should develop excellent communication skills.

46
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,310
Now, how do we deliver value?

47
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:17,560
There is only one way and this way is by making releases, you know that at the end of each sprint we

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,930
must have a potentially releasable increment.

49
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,340
But the releases might happen more frequently than that.

50
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,690
For example, in one sprint, you may have two or three releases or the opposite.

51
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,750
In two or three sprints, you may have just one release.

52
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,280
We can see a major release.

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,190
The point I'm making here is that we deliver value by releasing the increment.

54
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,710
And even though release planning is not an official storm event, it doesn't mean the product owner

55
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,370
doesn't do it.

56
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,950
OK?

57
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,280
There are many considerations.

58
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,410
That you have to make when you have to think about when you do release.

59
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,570
We will talk about more about that in the release when the release lecturer of the program.

60
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:01,140
But for now, let me give you just a few examples.

61
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:09,420
Can the customers absorb the product then your increment, or even if they can, can they absorb the

62
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,930
frequency maybe you're releasing too frequently?

63
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,790
The users need time to adapt.

64
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:21,710
Another consideration is that if if the product owner waits for too long, there's a risk that the value

65
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:28,350
of the increment the increment would deliver may get out of line with the marketplace in any case.

66
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,390
Once again, our product delivers value when it is released, if it is not released.

67
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,600
We are just working on it.

68
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,830
We don't have value.

69
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,180
We add only costs.

70
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,370
And this is why the waterfall model is not a good fit for software development.

71
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:51,510
If you're working between the company and you have stubborn managers that they cannot let go of the

72
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,500
waterfall model.

73
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,560
Instead of explaining everything you know about agile and scrum, you can ask them this question in

74
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,480
what timeframe?

75
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:04,560
When will our product deliver value to the end users?

76
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,360
What's that in eight months, in one year?

77
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,050
There is a chance many features wouldn't be used by the end users at all.

78
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,700
One reason is that the volume got out of line with the marketplace.

79
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,240
Remember, this is one of the considerations the product owner is making.

80
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:30,130
Another reason is unless you test your hypothesis with the marketplace, you cannot know if you are

81
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,310
right or wrong.

82
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:39,010
You've probably heard 45 percent of the features in the software product or never used in to waste the

83
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,030
wasting resources.

84
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,470
We are talking about here in comparison with Chrome and other agile methods and frameworks.

85
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,620
We deliver value each increment.

86
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,170
Possibly the release of the longest period to create the incrementing scrum is one month.

87
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,940
So in in one month we will have a potentially releasable increment.

88
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,570
Also, when we talk about value of its product owners, we should always consider the cost as well.

89
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,840
And here is why.

90
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,760
Let me ask you this.

91
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:14,210
Imagine you have developed three main features, the first one generates twenty three thousand dollars,

92
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:21,050
the second one generates fifty six thousand dollars, and the last one generates one hundred and eighty

93
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,400
thousand dollars.

94
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,090
Now.

95
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:28,960
Which feature delivered more financial value to the comic?

96
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,390
We cannot answer that question because we do not have enough information.

97
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:41,790
We cannot simply say the third feature because we do not know the cost.

98
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,970
What if feature number three cost us three hundred thousand dollars to develop in future, feature number

99
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,990
two cost us twelve thousand dollars to do?

100
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:58,000
This is why it's important to consider costs so you have a better understanding of the hour.

101
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:01,300
Why return on investment now?

102
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,790
For your example, PSP 01, here is what they expect from you.

103
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,730
When we talk about ordering the items in the product back.

104
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:16,810
Look, you order the items in a way that would increase the volume of the product or specifically based

105
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,740
on volume risk cost Independence's and quite positive.

106
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,850
You will see such a question or maybe more questions around that as well.

107
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:31,370
So, again, value cost risk, dependency, do not worry from now we will talk about that, a key.

108
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:41,370
Next, we can and should look at value with a more holistic approach and not just think about value.

109
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:48,240
The value we deliver outside the organization, meaning to the end users, but also inside the organization,

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,930
meaning to the employees and stakeholders.

111
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:59,810
We should know how to measure value and focus on four key value areas current value, unrealized value,

112
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,270
time to market and ability to innovate.

113
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:07,170
These are explained in the evidence based management guide.

114
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,830
We should read and understand is it will help us answer several questions on the exam, but we will

115
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,660
do that in the next lecture.

116
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,790
For now, let's do a recap.

117
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:27,420
Value can be financial and societal value is not only measured by income, revenue or money for non-profit

118
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:33,810
organizations, it may be increased safety or security, product ownership, excellent knowledge of

119
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,370
all the products in the marketplace.

120
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:42,120
If there is a difference in opinion between the end users and the customers, what you should consider

121
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,920
as most important is the end users opinion.

122
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,740
If they're happy, chances are everyone else will be happy to talk about other involved stakeholders.

123
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,280
Product owners deliver value by releasing the increment.

124
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,850
There is not a ruling strong that says how often we should release, we can release a few increments

125
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:08,730
at a time or we can also release a few times during the sprint.

126
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,160
The rule is each increment must be releasable.

127
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,950
The agile approach is better than the waterfall approach for software development because it delivers

128
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,100
value fast to the end users.

129
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:29,640
Waterfall delays followed by design product owners already the items in the product backlog in a way

130
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,880
that maximizes the value of the product.

131
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:40,240
According to the MBM Guide, there are four Kevo areas we should measure can improve current value,

132
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,710
unrealized value, time to market and ability to innovate.

133
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,150
Thank you for watching and stay purposeful.
