1
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:07,730
Is a product warmer, it is your responsibility to measure the progress of the project.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,720
You do this at least once per sprint.

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,720
You need to make sure the team delivers value after progress.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,370
Measurement is mandatory.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:22,550
But what is not mandatory are the diagrams or charts we would use to measure that progress.

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:25,610
Why is this lecture called Information Radiator's?

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,400
That is because the charts we use to measure progress radiate information.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,850
You know, one of the pillars since is transparency.

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:40,100
We can draw and update the chart, put it in a visible place in everyone in the team knows where we

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,400
are, by the way.

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,900
Do you remember who measures the progress of the sprint?

12
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,300
It's the development team, they do that daily and they know best what's going on during the sprint,

13
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,130
very common charge competition, their fuels are burned down and burn up charts.

14
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,700
You might see questions from your exam about them.

15
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,260
So let's start with the burned down chart.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,810
It's quite simple, by the way.

17
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,580
Here is how they look.

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:12,590
Here is how the burned out chart looks like.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,300
The horizontal axis shows the time, the vertical axis shows the amount of work, so the burned down

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:27,780
chart shows how much work is left or said, in other words, the amount of remaining work across time.

21
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:35,180
The green dotted line is a trend line that shows our planet progress, but the blue line is our real

22
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,780
progress.

23
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,190
This is what actually happens.

24
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,210
As you can see, the more PBIS we complete, the more the blue line moves down.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,550
You should know that the trend line is just an assumption when the project will be completed, if there

26
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,670
aren't any significant changes, or I should see no changes at all to the number of developers or the

27
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,850
scope of the project.

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,800
That's important because if you as a product owner constantly argue PBIS, basically you're changing

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,130
the scope of the project.

30
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,450
It would be impossible to end the project somewhere near the trend line.

31
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,640
Even those from international framework in energy, we don't do upfront planning.

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,260
Let's be realistic.

33
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,610
Sometimes the scrum teams will be working on a project with a deadline.

34
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,900
Now forget about the trend line for a moment and think of it as a deadline instead as a product where

35
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,800
you can draw this deadline yourself.

36
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,130
And what does it mean when the blue line is above the deadline?

37
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,870
It means we're behind schedule.

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,580
If we're under the red line, it means we are ahead of schedule.

39
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:48,350
Now the burned down chart can be used by the development team to measure the progress of this sprint.

40
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:55,260
The horizontal axis would show D and we can call it a spring burn down chart.

41
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:00,540
When the product owner uses such a chart, we can call it a project burn down chart.

42
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,940
Then the horizontal axis would natural names, but instead it would show Prince.

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,660
Besides, the burned down charred, a burned up chart also exists as a tool to track progress.

44
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,480
It shows the complete work and total work.

45
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,500
As you can see, the completed work start from zero and it goes up.

46
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,520
This chart shows any changes in the scope of the project.

47
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,870
The scope is the total amount of work, let's say we have a product backlog with temps estimated at

48
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,530
120 story points, that's our scope.

49
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,080
But the customer wants to add two more features.

50
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:40,530
More PBIS means more story points is a result.

51
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,900
The total amount of work increases.

52
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,980
And let's say that we've added to this worth 20 story points.

53
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,930
And the result is the blue line going up to 140 story points.

54
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:58,830
As you can see on the chart, if we remove PBIS, the burn up chart would reflect that as well.

55
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,840
The blue line would go down.

56
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,560
Now, some people would say it is better to use BORDENAVE charts instead of burned down because the

57
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,740
burned down chart doesn't show changes in the small bits.

58
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:17,220
That is not completely true because now instead of drawing it, you know, by hand, we have tools like

59
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,630
Jurez I've already mentioned.

60
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,910
And you can set it up in a way that the burned down chart would also show changes in the scope.

61
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,410
But this is not important.

62
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:31,880
As a product owner, it's up to you to choose how you will present showed the progress of the product.

63
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:37,260
And by the way, these are these are just two chart, but there are many more many more charts you can

64
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,740
use, for example, cumulative diagrams and in many other things.

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,730
But what is important here is your focus.

66
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,790
What do you focus on your measuring progress?

67
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,930
So that means everything should revolve around volume, not velocity and story points.

68
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:01,320
Yes, these charts are helpful, but the ultimate measure of success is the value your product delivers.

69
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,700
Let's do a quick recap.

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,030
Progress measure month is mandatory and strong, the economy measures the progress of the project once

71
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:16,230
first sprint to ensure value is being delivered, the burned out chart shows the remaining work across

72
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,520
time.

73
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,810
The trend line is simply a forecast and assumption when the project will end.

74
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,800
If there are no changes in scope and number of developers, the burn up chart shows the complete work

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,520
in total work.

76
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,680
Changes in the scope are clearly seen.

77
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,880
For your example, remember that chart of rooms are not mandatory.

78
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:40,510
Thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next lecture.

79
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,190
We will talk about an interesting topic, the cone of uncertainty.

80
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,100
And remember, state purposeful.
