1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,810
In this video, we'll talk about the product vision.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:12,610
This topic is quite important for any product owner because they are the people who defined infrequently

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,950
communicate that vision.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:17,770
A product owner is the chief product visionary.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,220
He or she needs to make sure everyone understands the product vision.

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,030
Do you remember how the Springle guides the development team during the spring?

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,540
Well, the product vision is quite similar, but on a larger scale it guides the whole swim team towards

8
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,650
the end goal, the destination, the place we call success.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,910
This program does not talk about product vision, but things from the talk.

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,100
You will find some resources on the topic.

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,090
So let's start from the very beginning.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,910
What is the product vision?

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,440
Well, first of all, before we start with, the product development is product owners.

14
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,910
We need to answer the question.

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,610
It's a very important question.

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,540
Why?

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,200
What are we going to develop the product?

18
00:00:58,510 --> 00:00:59,320
Let's keep it simple.

19
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:02,800
There is a problem in our product is the solution.

20
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:09,280
We cannot provide a good solution if we do not understand the problem on a deep level, and for that

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,700
reason I'm asking the question why helps us clarify revealed the real problems we are going to solve

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,510
with our product?

23
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:23,350
We should not be one of those people who jump straight on the solution and do not spend any time understanding

24
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,550
that the real problem.

25
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:31,740
So basically, the product vision is a short statement that is focused, clear and easy to understand.

26
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:34,560
It reflects the target audience and their needs.

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,580
It is emotional, I should say.

28
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,900
It can be emotional.

29
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,360
It is very persuasive.

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:44,800
It focuses on the outcome is if said, the destination we call success.

31
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,650
Now let's take a look at the vision of scrub the dog.

32
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:55,030
A world in which all software developers love their work and their customers love working with them,

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,500
as you can see, it is clear and focused.

34
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,590
The work love appears twice.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,340
So, yes, it is emotional.

36
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,610
I find it very inspiring.

37
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,120
Obviously, that's a company vision and not a product vision, but still it gives us an idea.

38
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,310
Let's take a look at another example.

39
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,100
Spotify.

40
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,580
I love their product.

41
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:21,610
We envision a cultural platform where professional creators can break free of their medium's constraints

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,360
and where everyone can enjoy an immersive or artistic experience that enables us to empathize with each

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,670
other and to feel part of a greater whole.

44
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,530
It's not a very short but nice vision anyway.

45
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,620
He will not be given a vision statement when your example of people wanting to determine which one is

46
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,930
good and which one is bad.

47
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,960
What you need to understand, however, here is the concept.

48
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:54,100
Now, as a product owner, it is your responsibility to communicate the vision of the product, not

49
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:00,990
just not just with the Scrum team, this promising development, but also to the stakeholders.

50
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,860
And this is not something we do once at the beginning of the project of the product development, for

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,720
example, nor the product owner should communicate the vision frequently.

52
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,590
He or she can use this from events to do so.

53
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,120
For example, spring planning is a great opportunity to remind the team about the product vision, but

54
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,700
also a spring preview because key stakeholders participate in the meeting as well as you remember.

55
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,340
Also, you know, that's French retrospective is about the way we do things.

56
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:35,440
So it would be correct if we also discussed the way we communicate the product vision, for example,

57
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:43,090
besides talking about it sometimes before we have it written and place it somewhere that's visible in

58
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,930
the visible place.

59
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,870
Having a product vision also creates transparency.

60
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:54,970
Everyone on the team has a common understanding of why we are building the product and and of course,

61
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,050
the customer needs.

62
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,470
Having said that, the whole strong team, not just the product owner, has to have an idea and they

63
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,120
have to know how the product earns revenue and they have to know the needs of the end users.

64
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,300
OK, time to recap.

65
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,790
The product owner is the chief product visionary.

66
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,500
The first thing the product owner does when starting a new product is defining the product.

67
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,510
The protocol communicates the product vision often to the team and stakeholders.

68
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,600
This prevents, besides leaks from or great opportunities for the product owner to remind the team and

69
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,320
stakeholders about the product vision.

70
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,810
The product vision increases transparency and it gives some direction to all Sprint's.

71
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,540
The product vision is focused, clear, easy to understand, it reflects the target audience in their

72
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,240
needs, it can be emotional and persuasive.

73
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:56,770
OK, in the next video, we'll talk about another important topic value.

74
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,260
Thank you for watching and stay purposeful.
