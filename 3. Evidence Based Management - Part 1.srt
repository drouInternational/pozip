00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:09,050
For your exam, besides reading and understanding this cronkhite, you must do the same for the evidence

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,630
based management guide.

3
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:17,760
Fortunately, it is short just 11 pages, but there will be a few or several questions on the examination.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,940
And of course, you need to be prepared.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,000
The purpose of this lecture is to point your attention to the most important areas in the guide.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,750
So let's read.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:35,030
Evidence based management guide how to continuously improve business results when measuring business

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:37,790
value and using empirical management.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:48,340
Overview organizations adopting agile product delivery practices can easily lose sight of their real

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:55,030
goal of improving the value they deliver by focusing on improving activities and outputs instead of

11
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,620
business outcomes.

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,030
Agile is a means to an end, not the end itself.

13
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,460
The whole point of adopting agile practices is to improve business performance.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,430
When organizations lose sight of this, managers ask questions that seem sensible but might create unintended

15
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:18,020
and undesirable consequences.

16
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,410
Some examples of such questions are.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,750
Is built automation present, are code standards or conventions being met?

18
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,210
What is the quality level of code artist first practices being used?

19
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,970
EU velocity increasing.

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,870
Our developers integrating the code frequently.

21
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,080
How frequently?

22
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,520
And I want to stop right here and make a few comments now.

23
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,500
For many people, these are just questions in bubbles, but there is much more than that.

24
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,900
For example, is team velocity increasing?

25
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,870
Well, this question derives from the fact that there are people who think or believe that velocity

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,610
is a measure of success.

27
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,340
And what was velocity, by the way?

28
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,990
Will you know that the development team is responsible for estimating the size of the PBIS?

29
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,060
A good practice is to use three points.

30
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,720
Three points are not mandatory, but do not worry about that for now.

31
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,640
Alisher, everything you need to know about scoring points in velocity, velocity, calculation in the

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:17,940
future.

33
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,020
Lecture for now.

34
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,770
Imagine for once the development team completes five PBIS each, PBI estimated with five story points.

35
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,410
So in total we have twenty five story points.

36
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,910
This is the development team's velocity during the next sprint.

37
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,690
If we complete PBIS worth thirty story points, we can say that the team's velocity increased by five

38
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,470
story points.

39
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,370
Great.

40
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,660
But does that mean we have delivered more value?

41
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:52,380
No, he does not mean that we simply do not know the correct answer here, would we?

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,320
It depends.

43
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,740
Can we use velocity as a measure of success?

44
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:04,110
No, we cannot velocity's about the speed at which the development team completes PBIS, but it does

45
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,210
not tell us if these PBIS will maximize the value of the product.

46
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,490
Be prepared for such a question on your exell.

47
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,090
Next, are developers integrating the calls frequently?

48
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,580
This is about the fact that code integration happens frequently during the sprint.

49
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:20,860
Why?

50
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,570
Because when the developers write a piece of called, you need to integrate it to the rest of the code

51
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,220
to see if it will work or not.

52
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:32,530
So when that's court integration, Heppell if happens frequently during the spring.

53
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,440
This is there is not an official event.

54
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,890
This is not an official event.

55
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,990
You know, code integration scrum doesn't tell us when to integrate the code.

56
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,560
We use the agile concept of continuous integration.

57
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,520
We'll talk more about that as well.

58
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,410
Next hour, test first practice is being used.

59
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,990
This one is good, I like it.

60
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,260
It refers to a practice called Test Driven Development, or TDD.

61
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,020
Yes, it's a good practice.

62
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,880
It does increase the quality of the.

63
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,490
But it's not mandatory strong.

64
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,620
By the way, TDD comes from extreme programming, which is one of the first, if not the first agile

65
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,160
framework.

66
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:16,160
In contrast to Scrum in XP, you will find many practices, for example, test driven development,

67
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,760
as I've said, pair programming, very, very famous collective called ownership.

68
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,840
It's more like a rule also refactoring.

69
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,330
And so all these are not mandatory in Akron, but often use.

70
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,130
As you understand by now, this has become more abstract and flexible in the same time, obviously,

71
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,640
the creators want to make it easy for companies to implement.

72
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,510
So test driven development programming, refactoring, great practices, widely used, but again, not

73
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:53,080
mandatory scrum developers may choose something else, and that is OK with crime.

74
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,330
Well, I do not think there is any substitute for concrete factory, but we will talk about that a bit

75
00:04:59,330 --> 00:04:59,660
later.

76
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,010
The next question is built automation, president, quality of cold, cold standards.

77
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:13,560
These questions are not wrong, but they're not the most important ones where you talk about measuring

78
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,130
value.

79
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,270
And if you think.

80
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,690
But, VladimÃ­r, quality of the cold, this relates to value.

81
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,630
If the court is right and well, free of bugs and users would be happy.

82
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,770
And here's my answer.

83
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,770
Yes, you have a point, but.

84
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,500
If the features that were used in this case, it will deliver zero value.

85
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:42,860
Next, while the answers to these questions are interesting, they do not help an organization improve

86
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,580
the value it delivers or its ability to deliver value monitoring, only that their use of practices

87
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,890
does not provide the best evidence of their effectiveness.

88
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:58,190
For example, tracking a development whose velocity says nothing about whether the team is actually

89
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,380
delivering something that is useful to customers or users without measuring value.

90
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:10,220
The success of any agile initiative is based on nothing more than intuition and assumption.

91
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:18,890
In contrast, the evidence based management EBM approach measures value delivered is evidence of organizational

92
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:23,900
agility and provides ways to measure and improve the ability to deliver value.

93
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:31,070
This approach enables organizations to make rational, fact based decisions, elevating conversations

94
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,500
from preferences in opinions to empirical evidence, logic and insight.

95
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,140
OK, let's recap now and we will continue with this guide in the next lecture.

96
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:49,630
Velocity is not a measure of success called integration happens frequently during the sprint test driven

97
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,240
development pair programming and user stories are good.

98
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,430
Practice is often used, but they are not mandatory in Skrull EBM approach measures.

99
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:04,510
Value delivered is evidence of organizational agility in provides ways to measure and improve the ability

100
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,650
to deliver value.

101
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,780
Thank you for watching in state.

102
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,710
Purposeful.
