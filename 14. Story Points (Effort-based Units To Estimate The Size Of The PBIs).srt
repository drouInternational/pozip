00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,380
Let's talk about story points.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,630
What are the story points are a relative unit of measurement.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,960
The keyword here is relative.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,170
For example, the team gets together and looks into a PBI.

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,550
Everyone has a good understanding of it and they estimate this item to be worth 10 story points.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:31,840
If they need to estimate another item twice as big, that will be 20 story points or if the team can

7
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,050
get the thoughts, can do a third item in half the time in comparison to the first item, that would

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,100
be five story points.

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,490
Now, as I've said, we are interested in the relative value here.

10
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,170
The same example will be accurate.

11
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,340
If I said that the first item is 100 story points.

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,390
The second item is twice as big, 200 story points.

13
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,540
In the third item is 50 story points.

14
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,690
The roll numbers do not matter here.

15
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:08,490
When we estimate which story points, we always consider all the work that has to be done designing,

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,020
coding, testing, integrating and so on.

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,610
In other words, we take into consideration the definition of done.

18
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,870
If we have some special tests in the definition of them, we consider this well.

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,150
Well, estimating as well.

20
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,360
And to make my point, I would like to quote a man whose opinion I respect very much when we talk about

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,670
scrum and other agile principles, methodologies, frameworks and so on.

22
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,360
His name is Michael, and here's what he says.

23
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:45,130
Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,730
to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work.

25
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:54,280
That's his definition of what story points are.

26
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,850
Mike talks about Deverall effort to fully implement a PBI.

27
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:07,930
As they've mentioned in earlier videos, we calculate the velocity of the team by combining the story

28
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:14,860
points, all of the items that were done in the past, during the past sprint or ideally an average

29
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,240
of the past several sprints.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,910
This helps us determine how many PBIS the development team can handle during the next sprint.

31
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,670
And not only that, but we would be able to see how many sprints are left in the project.

32
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,820
Of course, if the PBIS are estimated, let me give you some examples to clarify.

33
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:41,360
Let's say that during spring one, the team managed to complete PBIS, which totals three points, twenty

34
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:49,990
five sprint to twenty two, three points, sprint three twenty seven, sprint for twenty and Sprint

35
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,760
five thirty one.

36
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:59,110
So if we calculate that we will get a total of one hundred and twenty five story points divided by five

37
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,070
sprints, we give an average velocity of twenty five.

38
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:09,660
Let's say that we have a product backlog with PBIS worth two hundred and fifty three points.

39
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,720
How many sprints do we need to finish the project.

40
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,750
Two hundred and fifty divided by twenty five equals ten sprints.

41
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,280
What's also good is that we know that our sprints are two weeks long.

42
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,350
That means we complete ten sprints for five months.

43
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,340
This information is quite important for customers and not only any types of stakeholders are interested

44
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:36,730
in that.

45
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,750
But please remember the velocity of the team changes.

46
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,840
It needs several sprints to get it stable.

47
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,700
The good news is that we can always recalculate with the new numbers.

48
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,070
Finally, what do we consider when estimating when to help us to points?

49
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:04,610
Of course, we start with the amount of work, but we also consider uncertainty, risk and complexity.

50
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:13,250
If you would like to dig deeper into these factors, I would recommend you read the blog post What Our

51
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,590
Story Points by Mike Cohen.

52
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:21,850
You would not need this information for your exam, but you would need it for your practice.

53
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,150
So I recommend you take a look in the next video.

54
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,000
I would like to introduce to you the Ploning poker.

55
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,240
Thank you for watching and stay purposeful.
