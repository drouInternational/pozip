00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:06,400
In this lecture, we will talk about contracts and budgets.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,690
First of all, there are different types of contracts, but I want to present to that are the most widely

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,020
used.

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:20,530
Of course, every organization has its own budgeting process, but its product owners, we should know

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,750
how budgeting works.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:30,130
We want a positive airway, we should do budget revisions once for Sprint, we should be able to explain

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,420
to the stakeholders where the money goes.

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:39,660
The first type of contract is a fixed price and a second is time and material.

9
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:44,230
Yes, you might see variations of these, but generally here is how it works.

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,510
With fixed price, the customer knows how much it would cost to develop the software product.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,680
OK, that's good.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,770
But if you have to make an offer to the customer, how would you calculate that fixed price?

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,440
Well, you need a detailed plan.

14
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,620
You need to know exactly the scope of the project.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,040
That means a lot of upfront planning.

16
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,750
And was the problem with that?

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,930
Well, to start with, you know that this is not how agile works.

18
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,210
We're building the product incrementally.

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,980
We rely on feedback to adapt.

20
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,520
This is how we built the right product, not just any product.

21
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,860
So a fixed price contract is typical for the waterfall model is not fragile.

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,590
But is it is it still possible to have a fixed price contract and use the scrum framework?

23
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,080
Of course, any other ideal, a framework that exists?

24
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,300
And the answer is yes.

25
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,010
Sometimes as property owners, we do have a say in the budgeting process.

26
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,540
Sometimes we don't.

27
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,940
Nobody asks us and other times we ask for a fixed budget.

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,790
What do we do when we are asked to to to to say how much it would cost?

29
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:04,460
Some experts suggest that we at a price before we inflate the price, so to speak, because we know

30
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,040
that there will be a change of scope.

31
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,310
We know that the customer may request features more features after the releases and so on.

32
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:20,120
For example, in the book that I've been often citing here, the professional product owner author suggests

33
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,480
that.

34
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,500
We increase the cost of the spring by an extra member or two for development.

35
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,250
This is for risk mitigation.

36
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,820
And once we know the cost of the sprint and the potential velocity of the development team, we can

37
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,920
determine the number of sprints, for example, minutes.

38
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,100
Let's say, for instance, each one costs 100000 dollars.

39
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,640
That equals one million dollars for the product or for the project.

40
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:53,480
Another important point in the calculation here is that after the final release, there is a maintenance

41
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,020
period.

42
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,610
We don't know how long, but we should know about it.

43
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,020
We should have an idea and we should include that in the cost, even though we can have a fixed price

44
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,440
contract and be agile in the same way.

45
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,450
To some extent, yes.

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,450
You see that fixed price and scope limit agility.

47
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,060
Now, the other type of contract is time and material, basically we get paid by the time we spent developing

48
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,640
the product.

49
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,930
The good news here is that we do not need to the formula in the scope is not fixed.

50
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:33,260
We discovered the scope of the product by building and releasing increments, listening to feedback

51
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,400
from the marketplace.

52
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,480
In other words, this contract type is best for strong time and material types of contracts.

53
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:46,960
They are also flexible in the sense that the customer may increase or decrease the budget as we go,

54
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,820
as they see the value being delivered, as they see the return on investment.

55
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,700
As you can see, when we have a fixed price contract, most of the risk is on the organization that

56
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,690
develops the product.

57
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:08,090
But when we have a time in material type of context, most of the risk is on the customer and it's more

58
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,850
a more balanced approach in terms of risk is called kept time in material that.

59
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:21,490
Now the organization gets paid, but the time spent developing the product, as with the normal time

60
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,630
and material contract type.

61
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,050
But here we have a cap and that cap limits the total amount of spent.

62
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,150
So the customer never pays more than the cap, even if the development continues.

63
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:42,700
You will not see types of contracts on your exam, but I believe it's important to know at least the

64
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,470
basics here.

65
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,240
Lest we get.

66
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,940
The product owner revises the budget at least once, faceprint to make sure value is being delivered.

67
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,490
Generally, that's the end of the.

68
00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,630
A fixed price contract type with fixed scope means that upfront planning is required, which is against

69
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,070
the original beliefs.

70
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,450
Fixed price contracts limit agility, but it is still possible to execute product development.

71
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:13,950
The timing material contract type is grateful, strong and agile in general.

72
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,600
Thank you for watching and stay purposeful.
