00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,170
In this lecture, we'll talk about scaling strong.

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,080
As you know from the scrum, guys, the essence of scrum is a small team of people.

3
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,640
This is how it was initially designed.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:21,450
However, scaling scrum has also become popular and there are frameworks created created around that.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,730
For example, no one offered to buy from the dog is called Nexxus.

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:34,160
There is a Nexus Ghaffari probably you know it already, but there are also less safe and probably more

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,330
cases are you will see questions on your exam around scaley.

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,030
There are some rules that scrum that or believes in and they will test your understanding there.

9
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,710
This is because there are differences in the approaches in Skillings from Inscrutably doesn't agree

10
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:52,890
with.

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,480
So, for example, in some frameworks you can have multiple product toners for one product.

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,060
That's OK.

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,190
But according to come the term, this is not acceptable.

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,920
Now, let's take a look first.

15
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:12,360
And probably the most important thing is that for one product, you always have one product backlog,

16
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:19,830
one product goal in one product owner, regardless of how many teams are working on that product.

17
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,990
We spoke about that in 08.

18
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,240
And in the example in any images I prepared for you, we have three teams working on the same product.

19
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,240
As you can see, there is one product or one product backlog in the middle.

20
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,500
And we have multiple schoolmasters developers.

21
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:45,280
In this way, it's much easier and productive for one person to manage the product backlog, but there

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,650
is also a downside to it.

23
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,890
If too many teams are working on all the same product, the work for the product owner might become

24
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,490
too much.

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,480
He or she might be in a situation where they simply need help.

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:05,590
And if that's the case, the correct thing to do here is to delegate some of the responsibilities to

27
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:12,460
the development teams and not having multiple product owners or product or proxies or call them however

28
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,410
you want next.

29
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,810
Each team has its own sprint and we should know if we have to synchronize the sprint or what.

30
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,200
I'm talking about the length.

31
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,560
For example, we have three sprints, all of them two weeks.

32
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:26,860
What do we have to do that?

33
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,400
The answer is no, and many people will confuse here.

34
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,700
There is no such rule in.

35
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:40,760
This is how it would look like if we have three teams, the first one uses to be close friends and for

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,380
three months, that's the period they complete six points.

37
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,240
The second one uses one month long springs.

38
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,090
So they complete three sprints for three months, of course.

39
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,580
And the third one uses one week sprints in the complete well sprints for three months.

40
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,850
In this way, the teams are more flexible.

41
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,300
That's it.

42
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,190
Since each team has its own spring, that means they have their own spring backlog.

43
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,810
As you can see, the developer pulled the work from the same project back to their own sprint backblocks.

44
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:16,150
Next, the definition of done, do we have one or multiple?

45
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,200
I know you know the answer to this one, but here I will share just a few more details around that.

46
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:29,480
The answer is we can have multiple definitions of them, but there are some things we should know we're

47
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:29,760
looking at.

48
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,020
Let me be more specific.

49
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,650
These checklists are not completely different.

50
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,030
They have things in common and here is an example, on an organizational level, there is a definition

51
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,440
of done with five bullet points based on that definition.

52
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,080
That means create or craft one for the integrated increment.

53
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,720
That means they add more bullet points to the organization's definition of them.

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,750
So they end up with a definition of them for the integrated in increment with 10 bullet points, for

55
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,200
example.

56
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:11,010
Then each team can add more points and have its own definition of so one can end up with 12 bullet points.

57
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:16,240
Team two can end up with 13 bullet points in Team three with 11.

58
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,940
But here is the important part.

59
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,890
The definitions of done on a team level must be compatible with one another.

60
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:32,710
In this way, the teams can combine their work, the outputs of each sprint into one integrated increment.

61
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:43,010
I want to briefly talk about the scrum of scrubs in the scrum of scrums meeting, there is one participant

62
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:43,880
from each team.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,830
We can think of those people as representatives.

64
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,160
You know, that's in the normal daily scrum we have.

65
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,860
What do we do?

66
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,220
We it's about Ploning, the work for the next 24 hours, but also very important.

67
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,930
It's also about synchronization of the developers.

68
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:07,430
Well, scrum of scrums is similar, but the synchrony, the synchronization here happens on teams level,

69
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,890
OK, it's not within the team, but all teams synchronized together usually.

70
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,200
What do they talk about?

71
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:18,110
Usually the participants discuss cross team dependencies.

72
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,150
They share information, they talk about integration and more.

73
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,720
OK, let's recap.

74
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,750
One product has one product backlog, one product owner and one product goal.

75
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,970
At any given time, there can be one or multiple schoolmasters.

76
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,290
The reason is that the scrum master can work part time and act as such.

77
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,450
For more than one team, the length of the sprints does not have to be synchronized.

78
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,890
There can be multiple definitions of them as long as they're compatible.

79
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,640
The teams must be able to combine the outputs of their sprints into one integrated increment.

80
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:06,050
This video is great to help you pass the PSM one popular one exams, but for your work, if you have

81
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,830
to apply skills, then I highly recommend you.

82
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,180
You just pick one of the frameworks for savings from it and study it.

83
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,720
I let me repeat again next to save less and more.

84
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,440
Thank you for watching and stay purposeful.
