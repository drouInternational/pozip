1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:09,650
OK, let's continue with evidence based management, part two, IBM is an empirical approach that provides

2
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:15,530
organizations with the ability to measure the quality delivered to customers in the means by which they

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:21,500
deliver that value and to use those measures to get improvements in both.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:31,850
And now here is the important part, figure one EBM consists of four key areas unrealized value, current

5
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,420
value, ability to innovate in time to market.

6
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:42,370
OK, so listen, before Kvas give Schiavelli areas, you need to understand them as you will see questions

7
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,240
on your pure one exam, as they've already said.

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,400
For example, I'm certain I saw a question about time to market.

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,070
The good thing here is that these Kevo areas are super easy to understand.

10
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,470
Take a look at what the guide says.

11
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:03,600
Each KVA focuses on a different aspect of eider of value or the ability of the organization to deliver

12
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,280
value organizations without strength.

13
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:14,110
In all, four, Kiva's may deliver short term value, but will not be able to sustain it, delivering

14
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:17,170
value, happy stakeholders and satisfied employees.

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:23,650
Current values are important, but organizations must also show that they can meet market demand with

16
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,780
timely delivery time to market while being able to sustain innovation over time.

17
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:36,970
Ability to innovate continued investment in the product is justified based on measures of its yet unrealized

18
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,770
value that could be realized if the product possesses the right capabilities.

19
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:49,990
Now, let's briefly touch on each Cavaleri current value, as the name suggests, this area is above

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,560
the value the product delivers.

21
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,880
Now, as you can see, the guide gives us example questions to help us reevaluate the current value

22
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,340
area.

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,750
How happy are users in customers today?

24
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:04,610
Is their happiness improving or declining?

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,180
How happy are your employees?

26
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:09,860
Is their happiness improving or declining?

27
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,840
How happy are your investors and other stakeholders?

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,570
Is their happiness improving or declining?

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,790
Do you notice the keyword here?

30
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,780
Happiness.

31
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,800
But this is not new to you because we spoke about it in the electoral vote.

32
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:32,050
Now, each KVOA is associated with several key value measures at the end of the guide.

33
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,060
You'll see that K.V. Ms.

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,850
Eveillard measures explained.

35
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,530
It's not necessary for you to learn in my heart, but read them a few times and understand them.

36
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,450
These cavey Ms.

37
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:49,510
Show us what to measure and what to strive to improve by using learning looks.

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,450
But more about that a bit later.

39
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:00,670
The CVS for the current value area are revenue per employee product, cost ratio, employee satisfaction,

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,540
customer satisfaction and customer usage index.

41
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:13,390
Next time the market well, this KVOA has to do with speed, how quickly do we deliver value?

42
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,890
Do you remember one of the considerations of the product on the Web planning releases was he or she

43
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:25,370
must be careful not to miss the window that the increment would deliver value, because if the product

44
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,570
on wait for too long, the value the incremental would deliver might get out of line with the marketplace.

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:40,160
The curves here are built in integration, frequency release, frequency release, stabilization period.

46
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,020
Meantime, to repair cycle time and lead time.

47
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,280
Next ability to innovate.

48
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,140
This one is about the ability to deliver new capabilities and innovative solutions.

49
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,620
Now, I want to point your attention to this, a variety of things, Skinny Pete, a teen from being

50
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:06,730
able to deliver new capabilities and, well, spending too much time fixing defects or reducing technical

51
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,570
debt, having to maintain multiple code and so on and so on now.

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,880
I have a dedicated lecture on technical debt because it's a product you should be aware of these concepts,

53
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,480
but the sentence I've just read should be a reminder to us that the purpose of this print is to create

54
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,990
a potentially releasable increment that delivers value.

55
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:32,600
Scrum does not allow special spreads, for example, sprint for removing technical debt or a sprint

56
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,890
for removing bugs.

57
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,750
Technical Sprint's hardening sprint sprint zero do not exist in school.

58
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,320
And I'm certain you will see questions on your example about the CVS for the ability to innovate are.

59
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,030
Feature usage index.

60
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:59,540
Innovation rate defect trends on property index is fulled versus index technical debt production incident

61
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:08,060
trends, active court branches, time spent merging called between branches in time spent context switching.

62
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,400
Next, unrealized value.

63
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,260
This one is about the value that the organization could realize in the future, the product owner should

64
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,740
be aware if the unrealized value is high or low, if it is high, that means that there is great market

65
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,250
potential.

66
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,470
If it is low, it means that we are reaching the end of the product lifecycle.

67
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,670
There are only two key measures for the unrealized value area.

68
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:42,620
The first one is market share and this is the relative percentage of the market controlled by the product.

69
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,670
In the second one is customer or user satisfaction.

70
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:54,160
Yep, this is the difference between a customer or user desired experience in their current experience.

71
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,110
OK, now let's talk about the learning new.

72
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,350
How to improve empirically using evidence based management, step one, quantify how we quantify the

73
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,410
value in the form of KVI.

74
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,020
Ms.

75
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,240
Stepto measure caves, we establish a baseline, a starting point that we will compare to later step

76
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:27,810
three, Celenk Kvas Kevo areas to improve here we are advised to improve the Kvas one or few at a time.

77
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,710
Take them for Conduct's practice experiments to improve Kiva's step number five evaluate results.

78
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:43,380
Now, as you can see, I went over the learning so quickly on the popular one exam, I did not see questions

79
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:48,900
related to, for example, you're not expected to know the steps of the learning law, but you are expected

80
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,810
to know the key value areas in some of the key measures.

81
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,410
You're expected to know that the end goal is not to be agile.

82
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,140
The end goal is to deliver value.

83
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,350
Agile is, the guide says, is just a means to an end.

84
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:07,680
The end goal is not to implement a practice such as test driven development TDD or using story points

85
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,140
or user force or planning or you name it.

86
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,830
The main goal is to deliver value both internally.

87
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,530
To the team and stakeholders and externally to the end users.

88
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,600
A quick recap.

89
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,280
According to the event, guys, there are four key areas, current value, time to market, ability

90
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,250
to innovate, unrealized value.

91
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:39,600
Each Kevo area kaffiyeh is associated with the volume measures, cavey amps improving performance is

92
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,890
an iterative process.

93
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,200
It uses a learning loop.

94
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,650
We measure the current state, we set performance goals.

95
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,190
We do small experiments, and then we measure the results to gauge the effect.

96
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,720
Then we do that again and again and again continuously.

97
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,230
By now, we have an understanding of what success means, delivering value on time, happy customers,

98
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,550
teams and stakeholders in the next election.

99
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,920
We'll do a recap of the last four lectures and then we will do a quick quiz.

100
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,670
And after that, we'll talk about some wrong measures of success.

101
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,150
Thank you for watching and stay purposeful.
